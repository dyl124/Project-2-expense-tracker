- This boilerplate confomrs to the MVC paradigm and is intended for a full-stack web-app that uses the [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime environment, leveraging [`MySQL2 v^3.6.3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2/v/3.6.3) and [`Sequelize v^6.35.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize/v/6.35.1) for connecting and communicating with the `MySQL` database (db) and using [Express v4.18.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express/v/4.18.2) for the web framework/server-functionality.
- It includes additional dependencies for handling sessions and hashing passwords, as well as some dev-dependencies for linting, code formatting and monitoring/watching servers; for a full list, see [`package.json`](./package.json) in the repo.
